        "A Primary Key uniquely identifies each record in a table, ensuring that no two rows have the same key value. It enforces entity integrity by preventing null values in its column. A Foreign Key, on the other hand, is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the Primary Key in another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables. This linkage ensures referential integrity, meaning that a Foreign Key value must either match an existing Primary Key value or be null\n",

For instance, if you want to calculate the average salary per department, you would group by the department column and then apply the AVG() function to get results for each department\n",

        "Associative entities, also known as join tables, serve as an intermediary between two entities that share a many-to-many relationship. They contain foreign keys referencing the primary keys of both related tables, enabling the establishment of connections between them. For instance, if students can enroll in multiple courses and courses can have multiple students, an associative entity like \"Enrollments\" would hold references to both \"Students\" and \"Courses,\" effectively managing this complex relationship\n",
